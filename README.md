# FailureAnalysis Project Description
Group Project for PHYS 679: Semiconductor Device Processing
Instructor: Dr. Fuding Lin.

## Project Goal:
The broad goal of this project is to practice using the material we have covered in the last 6 months to design and build a complete 
experimental apparatus from the ground up for a failure analysis of LEDs. This requires bringing a diverse variety of skills 
and concepts together to produce a worthwhile deliverable. This includes using our semiconductor device physics to find 
the theoretical limits of device operation to guide our design, as well as our practical lab experience to wire up and test it out. 
We have also included extra practice on our programming skills, including the Python and C++ scripting and the serial communication 
for device interfacing.

The Arduino code is here:
  - [driver](https://github.com/loganRidings/FailureAnalysis/blob/main/ArduinoLEDdriver.ino) Arduino 0 controls power and current for the LEDs.
  - [current](https://github.com/loganRidings/FailureAnalysis/blob/main/currentUnit.ino) Arduino 1 measures the current across the resitor and sends it to the pi via serial pins.
  - [photoDiodeOne](https://github.com/loganRidings/FailureAnalysis/blob/main/photoOne.ino) Arduino 2 measures the current out of 5 of the photodiodes.
  - [photoDiodeTwo](https://github.com/loganRidings/FailureAnalysis/blob/main/photoTwo.ino) Arduino 3 measures the current out of 1 of the photodiodes.
  
  
The python script to run on the Pi is here: [SerialPython](https://github.com/loganRidings/FailureAnalysis/blob/main/failingDraft.py)
